You don't need to install. If you have a specific path to the JDK , uncomment the line in 'gradle.properties' file.

Then, run cmd or powershell 'replayer' folder and type:
``` bash
gradlew run
```

If you don't want to run the application after build
``` bash
gradlew build
```

Put on 'result.json' in folder '.../core/assets'
